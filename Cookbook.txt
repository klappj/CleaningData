This document describes the data cleaning activity required by this programming process.

Step 1. Install the dplyr and data.table packages in R: 
	Tested with data.table version 1.12.6 and dplyr 0.8.3
Step 2. Download the dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Step 3. Extract to the zip file to the folder directory
	This dataset is already extracted into the gitub repository. The code will break if you do not extract into the root diretory
Step 4. Run the run_analysis.R file

	Results are stored in the run_data_summary file, using R's write.table command. The corresponding read.table command is best for reading it.
